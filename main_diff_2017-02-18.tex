We can include some R code here. Hello

The plot in Figure \ref{fig:iprior.plot} is explained in further detail in \cite{jamil2017}. Notice that I have used a reference to the figure via \verb@\ref{fig:<name-of-chunk>}@. The following shows a side-by-side plot. We can also reference them Figure \ref{fig:iprior.residplot1} and Figure \ref{fig:iprior.residplot2}.

\begin{knitrout}
\definecolor{shadecolor}{rgb}{1, 1, 1}\color{fgcolor}\begin{figure}
\subfloat[The left plot.\label{fig:iprior.residplot1}]{\includegraphics[width=7cm,height=7cm]{figure/iprior_residplot-1} }
\subfloat[And the right one.\label{fig:iprior.residplot2}]{\includegraphics[width=7cm,height=7cm]{figure/iprior_residplot-2} }\caption[Side-by-side plot]{Side-by-side plot}\label{fig:iprior.residplot}
